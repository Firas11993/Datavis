                    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
                    <p>Is traveling and discovering new places and people your
                    passion?<br>Do you want to feed that passion without burning
                    through your pocket?</p>

                    <p>As a group of students, this is the situation we found
                    ourselves in: eager to go on trips, but with the need to
                    balance our trips and spending.</p>

                    <p>With that in mind, we built this application that lets
                    you visualize and easily decide which city to visit in
                    France, based on the budget you want.</p>

                    <h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
                    <img class="center" src="img/screenshot1.jpg"></img>
                    <p>On the map, you can see all the stops near important
                    cities as blue markers. If you zoom in, you can also see
                    other, less important stops. Important cities are simply
                    historic cities (cities with historical monuments) or
                    cities that are classified by France as
                    <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villes_et_Pays_d'art_et_d'histoire" target="_blank">Villes d'Art et d'Histoire</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>You can select your budget for the trip by using the
                    scroller on the top left corner and the starting station by
                    filling the text box right above it. You can also select a
                    starting station from the map, by clicking on a city's
                    marker then pressing the "Set as starting location"
                    button.</p>
                    <img class="center" src="img/screenshot2.jpg"></img>
                    <p>By selecting the starting station, you should see all
                    the possible routes you can take with the chosen budget.
                    The colors used for the edges reflect the price of the trip
                    to a linked station. The closer the color to red, the
                    closer it is to your limit budget. Similarily, the closer
                    it is to green the cheaper the trip price is. Note that you
                    can always check the legend next to the scroller.</p>
                    <img class="center" src="img/animation.gif"></img>
                    <p>Clicking on a stop will show some additional information
                    on a sidebar to the left, such as interesting cities
                    that can be accessed once you're at selected stop.</p>
                    <p>There, you can click on a nearby city's name in that
                    list to show a short summary about the city, as well as a
                    list of monuments you can visit there.</p>
                    <img class="center" src="img/screenshot3.jpg"></img>
                    <p>An alternate view is also offered to view detailed
                    routes info: the right sidebar will show you a sorted list,
                    and you can expand a specific route you're interested in to
                    view the exact stops and durations/price breakdown.
                    Additionally, hovering your mouse on one of the items will
                    preview that path on the map (and in reverse, clicking on a
                    path on the map will open that item's details view in the
                    right sidebar).</p>
                    <img class="center" src="img/screenshot4.jpg"></img>
                    <p>That's it for the usage instructions! We tried to make
                    the tool as friendly and useful as possible. You can find
                    the interactive tool just below, so please feel free to
                    take it for a spin. We hope you enjoy it and find it
                    useful!</p>

                    We unfortunately couldn't resolve some issues with
                    the datasets we're using (obtained from
                    <a href="https://data.sncf.com/explore/" target="_blank">SNCF</a>).<br>
                    This is mostly due to (1) incomplete or outdated data
                    offered by SNCF; (2) severe inconsistencies between the
                    data sources.<br>
                    We also had to use the full prices for the tickets, as that
                    was the only consistent data point we could access.
                    You might notice that your favorite metro stop is missing,
                    or that some routing paths are not present when they should
                    be.<br>
                    We did our best to fix as many of these issues as
                    possible, and hope you'll enjoy interacting with our tool.
                    (In case we find more consistent data sources, we'd also
                    love to adapt our tool to use these instead.)
